Geographic data visualized with particles.

A prototype of a particle effect I made for an immersive exhibit. This uses GIS
data retrieved from Google and creates a voxel representation of the given
region of the globe.

This was created using Unity's VFX Graph. The pulse effect was originally
envisioned as a method of transitioning between maps.
