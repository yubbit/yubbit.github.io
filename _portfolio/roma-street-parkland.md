A 3D scan of Roma Street Parkland in Brisbane, Australia.

This was taken with a Google Pixel 6A. The initial reconstruction was done in
RealityCapture (now RealityScan), and the Gaussian splat was generated using
Nerfstudio using `splatfacto-big`.

The initial reconstruction ran into some issues with loop closure, so I had to
manually stitch parts of the scene by manually defining control points.
