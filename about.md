# Building the Future of Immersive Experiences

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about crafting immersive experiences. My work
blends cutting-edge technology, from 3D projection and VR/AR to advanced AI, 
to create engaging and impactful applications.

My expertise lies in immersive systems, encompassing a range of technologies 
including 3D projection, CAVE (Cave automatic visual environment) setups, and 
virtual/augmented reality. I'm also proficient in 3D scanning techniques, 
particularly photogrammetry and 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging 
state-of-the-art methods to create detailed and realistic 3D models.

I've developed immersive augmented reality experiences for museums and academic 
research institutions. Some of my early prototypes explored the use of early 
large language models to enhance these experiences, incorporating 
speech-to-text, computer vision, and document retrieval to create more 
interactive and personalized interactions.

I hold a Master of Information Technology from the University of New South 
Wales, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to that, I earned a 
Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Ateneo de Manila University, 
with a focus on Mathematical Finance. This strong foundation in both mathematics 
and AI, combined with my experience working in the humanities, allows me to 
approach complex problems with a uniquely interdisciplinary perspective.
