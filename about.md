# Building the Future of Immersive Experiences

I'm a software engineer with a focus on immersive experiences. I bridge cutting-edge technologies like 3D projection, VR/AR, and AI to build applications that are both engaging and impactful. My background in mathematics and AI gives me a unique perspective for solving complex problems.

My expertise lies in immersive systems — from 3D projection and CAVE (Cave Automatic Visual Environment) setups to virtual/augmented reality. I'm also deeply involved in 3D scanning techniques like photogrammetry and 3D Gaussian Splatting, using cutting-edge methods to create detailed, realistic 3D models that push the boundaries of what's possible.

I've built immersive augmented reality experiences for museums and academic research institutions. Early in my career, I experimented with leveraging large language models to enhance these experiences — using speech-to-text, computer vision, and document retrieval to create more interactive, personalized interactions. It's the kind of work where I get to blend tech with storytelling, and I'm always excited to see how these tools can make complex ideas feel more human.

I hold a Master of Information Technology from the University of New South Wales, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Ateneo de Manila University, with a focus on Mathematical Finance. My background in math and AI, paired with hands-on work in the humanities, helps me tackle complex problems from unexpected angles. It's the kind of work where I get to blend tech with storytelling.
